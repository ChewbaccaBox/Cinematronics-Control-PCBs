# Cinematronics Control PCBs

***THIS PROJECT IS INCOMPLETE AND STILL IN PROGRESS***

A collection of reproduction PCBs from Cinematronics Arcade games.
They typically hold the keytronics switches or optos, or are used
to link up buttons to the ribbon cable.
If you're missing one, they are VERY HARD to find replacements.
So this is a project of mine to make replacements, hopefully for all of them one day.

Typically, for these PCBs, I won't be tradtionally recreating them in a digital / new format.
Instead I'll trace the scans in illustrator since I'm trying to make them as accurate as possible. 
At that point, I guess it becomes more of an art. But they'll still be functional.
